Pre-Courses – Getting Everyone AI-Ready
Why Pre-Courses?
At the University of AI, we welcome students from diverse backgrounds — not everyone joins us as a programmer, data scientist, or AI engineer.
To ensure everyone starts on the same level, we offer mandatory pre-courses ("Vorkurse") before the first semester begins.

These courses build essential foundations in:

Programming & technical thinking

Mathematics & logic for AI

Basic data handling

Introduction to AI tools & ethics

🧠 Our goal: Equal opportunity for success — no matter your prior experience.

📚 What You’ll Learn
Module	Title	Description
1	Python Basics	Variables, loops, functions, file operations — the core of AI programming.
2	Math & Logic for AI	Linear algebra, probability, and Boolean logic – made simple and visual.
3	How AI Works	Overview of algorithms, models, neural networks, and learning types.
4	Using AI Tools	First steps with ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and no-code AI tools.
5	Prompt Writing 101	Learn how to effectively talk to AI using prompts.
6	Data 101	What is good data? CSVs, JSON, APIs, and basic cleaning & structuring.
