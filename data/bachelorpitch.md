🌍 Bachelor Pitch Fair
Discover innovation. Built by the next generation.

The Bachelor Pitch Fair is a digital showcase of all final-year Bachelor projects at the University of AI. Organized like an interactive online trade fair, it allows visitors, partners, and students to explore, filter, and deep-dive into real-world AI applications developed during the bachelor thesis phase.

It’s not just a presentation — it’s an interactive portfolio of future AI talent.

Interactive format: Each project has its own “booth” with media, demos, and contact options
