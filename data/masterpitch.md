🚀 Master Pitch Day
Where innovation meets the spotlight.

Master Pitch Day is the culmination of the University of AI experience — a live, highly anticipated event where our graduating students present their AI-driven thesis projects to industry leaders, mentors, instructors, partners, and peers.

Each project reflects months of applied research, AI tooling, innovation, and collaboration, aligned with real-world problems and technology trends.

🎤 What Is the Master Pitch?
It’s not a theoretical exam.
It’s a live demonstration of your impact.

Students present a 15-minute pitch of their Master project

Followed by 5-minute live Q&A with an expert jury

Projects are presented to the public audience, partners & press

Winners receive certificates, funding opportunities, and internships

Pitch Day is recorded and featured in the official University of AI Portfolio
